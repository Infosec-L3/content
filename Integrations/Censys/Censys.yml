description: 'Censys is a search engine that allows computer scientists to ask questions
  about the devices and networks that compose the Internet. Driven by Internet-wide
  scanning, Censys lets researchers find specific hosts and create aggregate reports
  on how devices, websites, and certificates are configured and deployed. '
detaileddescription: 'Two commands aspects of the Censys.io API is available, Search
  (cen-search) and View (cen-view). Cen-view is the primary interface. Automations
  should take the output of cen-view to parse and display the relevant data. Cen-search
  requires a more advanced search syntax and should be used primarily in pivoting
  and hypersearch scripts. More information on the search syntax can be found: https://censys.io/api/v1/docs/search'
